	Create S3 bucket to AWS.
	Insert file into the bucket
	Create policy for S3 bucket for List, Read,Write

      ]
    }
  ]
}
	Crete role using above policy, check option for external and give Id name
	Open snowflake
	Under workspace, 
•	Create DATABASE demo
•	Create SCHEMA schema_name
	To communicate between snowflake and S3 we need to create INTEGRATION as
•	Create or replace STORAGE integration integration_name
type = external_stage
storage_provider = ‘S3’
enabled = true
storage_aws_role_arn = 'arn:aws:iam::898915526951:role/Snowflake-s3-policy'
storage_allowed_locations = ('s3://snowflake-s3-aws/');
	Check commands
•	SHOW INTEGRATIONS;
•	DESC integration aws_s3_integration;
	DESC integration aws_s3_integration, gives the details of the connection details.
	To communicate with AWS through Snowflake, copy details of 
•	STORAGE_AWS_IAM_USER_ARN
•	STORAGE_AWS_EXTERNAL_ID
To policy.
	For the policy update, open roles > trust relationships > edit policy > give value to AWS and external respectively > update policy
	Grant to permission to run the integration for accountadmin by
•	GRANT usage on integration aws_s3_integration to role accountadmin;
	Create file format
create or replace file format demo_format
type = 'CSV'
field_delimiter = '|'
skip_header = 1;
	Create stage
create or replace stage demo_aws_stage
storage_integration = aws_s3_integration
file_format = demo_format
url = 's3://snowflake-s3-aws/';
	To list the files of S3 bucket from Snowflake
•	List @demo_aws_stage;
	To delete the files of S3 bucket from Snowflake 
•	remove @demo_aws_stage/ --- deletes all the files 
•	remove @demo_aws_stage/name_of_file --- deletes only specific files
